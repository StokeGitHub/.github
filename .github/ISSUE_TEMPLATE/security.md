Disclaimer: Please note that reporting of security issues is usually done though a different reporting mechanism in order to not expose the security flaw/exploit/compromise publicly. However, at the moment, the general aim is to provide a means to report security issues rather than not, even if that means that they are publicly exposed. But, beware that the details, or the issue itself, may disappear from the issue log. We will endeavour to replace the deleted issue with one that does not contain the compromise instruction if we have to delete it while a solution is found.
